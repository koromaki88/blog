# koromaki88's Personal Professional Blog
Website for documenting my personal thoughts, learning, write-ups related to software, CTFs and IT in general. Think of it as a digital journal.

## Acknowledgement
Built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/). Using a framework because I just wanted a working solution, I may work on a more personalized, hand-made website in the future.
