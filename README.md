# koromaki88's Personal Professional Blog
[Check it out!](https://koromaki88.pages.dev/) Website for documenting my personal thoughts, learning, write-ups related to software, CTFs and IT in general. Think of it as a digital journal.

## Development
Clone repository with PaperMod submodule
```sh
# https
git clone --recursive https://github.com/koromaki88/koromaki88-pages.git koromaki88-pages
# ssh
git clone --recursive git@github.com:koromaki88/koromaki88-pages.git koromaki88-pages
```
Run server locally (add `-D` to include drafts):
```sh
hugo server
```

## Acknowledgement
Built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/). Using a framework because I just wanted a working solution, I may work on a more personalized, hand-made website in the future.
