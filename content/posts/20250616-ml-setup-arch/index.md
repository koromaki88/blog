I decided to dedicate a blog post for this, mostly because my preferred setup process on Arch was a lot more confusing that it needed to be. This is just what I find to give me the most control and flexibility, but feel free to argue against it. Otherwise, if you found this helpful, then I'm glad to have helped :D

# Miniconda
I picked Miniconda over Anaconda Distribution, because I want a minimal base environment and manually install what I need later on - mostly because I'm working with a 500GB SSD and am very nitpicky about disk space. The installation process should be the same regardless.

On Arch, Miniconda can be installed either through the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/miniconda3) or [official installation script](https://anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install#linux-terminal-installer).

# VSCode
